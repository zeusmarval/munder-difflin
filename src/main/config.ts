 *      `webhookTriggers` is already populated — the user has moved on, and
 *      re-adding a synthesised entry would resurrect a revoked endpoint.
 *   2. The seeded `compact-maintenance` mission moves from the old 1h cadence to
 *      2h, but ONLY if it still reads exactly 1h. A user-chosen interval is a
 *      decision, not a stale default, and is left alone.
 *
 * Wrapped end-to-end in a try/catch: a config that is corrupt in some unrelated
 * way must still boot the app, and a migration is never worth a failed launch.
